# AZEROTH AT WAR — Unit Customization System
## Draft v0.1

---

## 1. EQUIPMENT SELECTION (All Units Including Heroes)

All units pick their **weapon** and **armor** from their faction's equipment list when building your army. Each unit card specifies which weapons and armor that unit is **allowed to take**. Heroes also choose equipment from their faction list — their Class may restrict which options are available.

Points cost adjustments for equipment TBD in final Army Books.

## EQUIPMENT SELECTION RULES

- Each unit card lists which **weapons** and **armor** that unit may take.
- A model equips **one weapon** (or one weapon + Shield) and **one armor**.
- Ranged weapons are taken **in addition to** a melee weapon (model carries both).
- Heroes choose from the same faction equipment list. Their Class may restrict options (e.g., a Priest cannot take Plate Armor or a Greatsword).
- Equipment choices are made during army building and are fixed for the game.

## 2. HERO BUILDER (Race → Class → Spec)

Heroes are built in three layers:

### Layer 1: RACE
Sets **base stats** and **1 racial keyword/ability**.

### Layer 2: CLASS
Sets **equipment options**, **ability list**, and **role**.

### Layer 3: SPEC
Adds **1–2 bonus abilities** or **keyword upgrades** that specialize the Hero.

---

## ALLIANCE RACES

---

## SCOURGE

## 3. HERO LEVELS

Heroes are recruited at **Level 1, 2, or 3**. Spec is chosen at Level 1. Higher level Heroes are more powerful but cost more points.

| Level | What You Get | Total Abilities |
|---|---|---|
| **Lv.1** | 1 global class ability + 1 once per game class ability + 1 spec ability | 3 |
| **Lv.2** | +1 global class ability + 1 spec ability | 5 |
| **Lv.3** | +1 once per battle **ultimate** (spec-specific) | 6 |

**Example — Orc Shaman (Elemental Spec):**
> **Lv.1:** Lightning Bolt *(global)* + Reincarnation *(once per game)* + Chain Lightning *(Elemental spec)*
> **Lv.2:** + Healing Wave *(global)* + Earth Shock *(Elemental spec)*
> **Lv.3:** + **Earthquake** *(once per battle ultimate)*

**Example — Death Knight (Frost Spec):**
> **Lv.1:** Death Coil *(global)* + Army of the Dead *(once per game)* + Frost Strike *(Frost spec)*
> **Lv.2:** + Unholy Aura *(global)* + Icy Touch *(Frost spec)*
> **Lv.3:** + **Remorseless Winter** *(once per battle ultimate)*

A Level 3 Hero is a major investment — 6 abilities including a game-changing ultimate. A Level 1 Hero is cheap (3 abilities), giving you more points for troops.

---

## 4. HERO POINTS COST

Hero cost is calculated as:

> **Race base cost + Class cost + Spec cost = Total Hero PTS**

Exact costs TBD in final Army Books. This modular system means two "Orc Warriors" can play completely differently based on spec and weapon choice.

---

## 4. RACE → CLASS AVAILABILITY MATRIX

### Alliance

| Race | Warrior | Paladin | Priest | Mage | Druid | Hunter |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Human | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — | — |
| Dwarf | ✓ | ✓ | — | — | — | ✓ |
| Night Elf | ✓ | — | — | — | ✓ | ✓ |

### Horde

| Race | Warrior | Shaman | Hunter | Druid | Shadow Hunter | Priest |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Orc | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — | — | — |
| Tauren | ✓ | ✓ | — | ✓ | — | — |
| Troll | ✓ | — | ✓ | — | ✓ | — |
| Forsaken | ✓ | — | — | — | — | ✓* |

*Forsaken Priest is locked to Shadow spec only.*

### Scourge

**Scourge Heroes are fixed — no Race/Class/Spec customization.** Each Scourge Hero is a complete unit with predetermined stats, equipment, keywords, and abilities. Pick from:

- **Death Knight** — Melee / Caster hybrid. Frost or Unholy spec.
- **Lich** — Pure caster. Frost or Necromancy spec.

Scourge Heroes still choose a spec, but their race and class are locked together. This reflects the rigid hierarchy of the Lich King's army — you don't choose what you become.

*"Choose your champion. Forge your legend."*
