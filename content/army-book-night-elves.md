# AZEROTH AT WAR — Army Book: NIGHT ELVES (Kaldorei)
## Version 0.1 (Unit List & Archetypes)

*Elune-adore!*

---

## FACTION IDENTITY

**Theme:** Ancient, stealthy, nature-bound. Guerrilla warfare and druidic shapeshifting.

**Playstyle:** Hit-and-run. High INI across the board (lots of LA + LW), Stealth on many units, strong archery. Druids can shapeshift (bear form = tank, cat form = assassin). They want to control engagement — picking fights on their terms, using forests as home territory, and never letting the enemy pin them down.

**Faction Mechanic — Shadowmeld:** At the start of any round, Night Elf models that did not attack or use abilities last round may gain Stealth until they act. Represents melding into shadows when still.

---

## HEROES

*Night Elf Heroes are preset profiles. Choose a Hero type, pick a spec, and choose a level (1–3). Each Hero has a racial ability, a once-per-game ability, and abilities gained by level.*

## BASELINE

---

### Sentinel
**Tier:** Baseline | **Archetype:** Skirmisher
**Keywords:** Stealth

Fast, stealthy, and nearly impossible to hit in melee (Eff. INI 7). Dual-role melee and ranged. Fragile if caught — TGH 3 and DEF 6+ means every hit that lands hurts. Their defense is not getting hit at all.

| MOV | ATK | SKL | STR | TGH | DEF | INI | WND |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 6 | 2 | 4+ | 3 | 3 | 6+ | 5 | 2 |

**Ranged:** Throwing Glaive 18", Ranged STR 3

**Allowed Equipment:** Dagger, Throwing Glaive, Longbow, Leather

---

### Archer
**Tier:** Baseline | **Archetype:** Core Ranged
**Keywords:** —

The backbone of Kaldorei ranged warfare. Longbow specialists who rain arrows from concealed positions. Better range and accuracy than Sentinels with throwing glaives, but without Stealth they rely on distance rather than ambush. Elven agility makes them hard to hit even without heavy armor.

| MOV | ATK | SKL | STR | TGH | DEF | INI | WND |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 6 | 2 | 3+ | 3 | 3 | 6+ | 5 | 2 |

**Ranged:** Longbow 24", Ranged STR 3

**Allowed Equipment:** Longbow, Dagger, Leather

---

## MOUNTED

---

*(Night Elves have no standard Mounted units — their speed and Stealth serve as mobility. Druids can shapeshift for different roles.)*

---

## ELITE

---

### Druid of the Claw
**Tier:** Elite | **Archetype:** Shapeshifter
**Keywords:** Magical

Choose form at start of each activation:

> **Bear Form:** Gain Taunt, high TGH/WND, Regeneration [1]. Cannot cast.
> **Cat Form:** Gain Disengage, Stealth, Decisive Blow [2]. Cannot cast.

**Allowed Equipment:** Dagger, Leather (caster form; forms override equipment)
