# AZEROTH AT WAR — Army Book: DARKSPEAR TROLLS
## Version 0.1 (Unit List & Archetypes)

*Who you wan' me kill?*

---

## FACTION IDENTITY

**Theme:** Voodoo, regeneration, berserker fury, primal savagery.

**Playstyle:** Regeneration and Berserker everywhere. Trolls get tougher to kill as the fight goes on — they heal, they get angry, they hit harder. Shadow Hunters and Witch Doctors provide powerful voodoo magic (hexes, wards, healing). Raptor Riders for fast cavalry. Headhunters for thrown weapons. They want prolonged fights — the longer the battle lasts, the more the Trolls dominate through attrition and escalating power.

**Faction Mechanic — Voodoo Shuffle:** Darkspear models that pass a Morale test gain +1 ATK die until their next activation. Surviving fear makes them fight harder.

## HEROES

*Darkspear Heroes are preset profiles. Choose a Hero type, pick a spec, and choose a level (1–3). Each Hero has a racial ability, a once-per-game ability, and abilities gained by level.*

## BASELINE

---

### Troll Berserker
**Tier:** Baseline | **Archetype:** Aggressive Infantry
**Keywords:** Berserker, Regeneration [1]

Heals every turn and gets angrier as it bleeds. Light armor (DEF 6+) but Regeneration [1] effectively adds 1 wound per round — they're harder to put down than they look. Higher INI than Orcs (Eff. INI 5 with LA) makes them evasive in melee.

| MOV | ATK | SKL | STR | TGH | DEF | INI | WND |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 6 | 2 | 4+ | 4 | 3 | 6+ | 4 | 3 |

**Allowed Equipment:** Axe, Dagger, Leather

---

### Headhunter
**Tier:** Baseline | **Archetype:** Ranged Skirmisher
**Keywords:** Berserker

Troll throwing axe specialists. Only 12" range but RSTR 4 hits hard at close quarters. MOV 6 lets them close to throwing range fast, then bury axes in faces. Berserker makes them dangerous even after taking hits.

| MOV | ATK | SKL | STR | TGH | DEF | INI | WND |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 6 | 2 | 4+ | 3 | 3 | 6+ | 4 | 3 |

**Ranged:** Throwing Axe 12", Ranged STR 4

**Allowed Equipment:** Throwing Axe, Dagger, Leather

---

## MOUNTED

---

### Raptor Rider
**Tier:** Mounted | **Archetype:** Fast Cavalry
**Keywords:** Berserker, Regeneration [1]

Troll warriors mounted on swift raptors. Faster than Wolf Riders but less armored. Regeneration keeps them in the fight while Berserker makes them increasingly dangerous. A hit-and-run predator that refuses to die.

**Allowed Equipment:** Axe, Throwing Axe, Dagger, Leather

---

## ELITE

---

### Witch Doctor
**Tier:** Elite | **Archetype:** Caster / Support
**Keywords:** Magical

Ward summons (sentry, healing, stasis), voodoo debuffs. Fragile but high utility. Provides Magical keyword for Mana generation.
