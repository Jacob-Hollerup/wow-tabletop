# AZEROTH AT WAR — Army Book: ORCS (Orgrimmar)
## Version 0.1 (Unit List & Archetypes)

*Lok'tar ogar! Victory or death!*

---

## FACTION IDENTITY

**Theme:** Savage, honorable, shamanic. Brute force meets elemental magic. Sprint across the field and hit like a freight train.

**Playstyle:** Fast and brutal. Orcs have the highest base MOV of any infantry faction (MOV 6 on Warriors) and high STR/ATK across the board. Berserker keyword on many units — Orcs get *stronger* as they take damage. Momentum on more units than any other faction — even Warriors hit harder on the charge. Shaman Heroes provide elemental magic (lightning, earth, fire). Wolf Riders are among the fastest cavalry in the game. The Orc game plan is simple: close the gap before the enemy can react, crash into their line, and overwhelm with raw aggression.

**Faction Mechanic — Blood Fury:** Once per game, during the Mana Phase, the Orc player may declare Blood Fury. All Orc models gain **+1 ATK die** and **+1 MOV** this round. The ultimate war cry — a surging, unstoppable charge.

## HEROES

*Orc Heroes are preset profiles. Choose a Hero type, pick a spec, and choose a level (1–3). Each Hero has a racial ability, a once-per-game ability, and abilities gained by level.*

## BASELINE

---

### Orc Warrior
**Tier:** Baseline | **Archetype:** Core Infantry
**Keywords:** Berserker, Momentum [1]

The Horde backbone — fast, aggressive, and dangerous. MOV 6 makes them the fastest baseline infantry in the game. ATK 3 is the highest of any baseline unit. Momentum [1] pushes a charge to 4 dice. Gets even more dangerous when wounded (Berserker → 5 dice on a wounded charge). They close the gap before you're ready.
