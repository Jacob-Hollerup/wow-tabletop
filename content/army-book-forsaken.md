# AZEROTH AT WAR — Army Book: FORSAKEN (Undercity)
## Version 0.2 (Complete Roster)

*What joy is there in this curse?*

---

## FACTION IDENTITY

**Theme:** Cunning, vengeful, plague and shadow. The dead who chose to fight back. Free-willed undead who broke from the Scourge and forged their own dark nation within the Horde.

**Playstyle:** Attrition and debuff-focused. Plague mechanics weaken enemies over time (-1 TGH, -1 ATK, -1 DEF). Dark Rangers provide elite ranged support with Stealth and Decisive Blow. The Royal Apothecary Society deploys chemical warfare. Some models have the Undead keyword (immune to Morale but can't heal), others are living Forsaken allies with normal Morale. This split creates interesting army-building choices. Val'kyr are the only models in the entire game that can heal Undead — making them high-priority targets.

**Faction Mechanic — Blight:** Forsaken models with the Plague keyword can leave Blight tokens on the battlefield when they activate. Enemy models that move through or end their turn on Blight suffer 1 automatic wound (DEF save allowed). Blight persists for 2 rounds (3 rounds if placed by the Grand Apothecary).

## HEROES

*Forsaken Heroes are preset profiles. Choose a Hero type, pick a spec, and choose a level (1–3). Each Hero has a racial ability, a once-per-game ability, and abilities gained by level.*

### Dark Lady *(Forsaken Hero)*
**Tier:** Hero | **Archetype:** Ranged / Commander
**Keywords:** Magical, Undead, Stealth, Decisive Blow [2]
**Specs:** Dark Ranger or Banshee
**Allowed Equipment:** Longbow, Dagger, Leather

| MOV | ATK | SKL | STR | TGH | DEF | INI | WND | PTS |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 6 | 3 | 2+ | 4 | 3 | 5+ | 6 | 4 | 140 |

**Ranged:** Longbow 24", Ranged STR 5

The Forsaken's supreme commander. A cold, calculating killer whose dark arrows corrupt and debilitate. Silence shuts down enemy casters. As Undead, she never breaks — but she can never be healed (unless a Val'kyr intervenes). She doesn't raise mindless dead like the Scourge — she dominates the living, turning their will against them.

**Racial — Undying Will:** This Hero has the Undead keyword (immune to Morale, immune to Taunt, cannot be healed except by Val'kyr Shadow Mend).
**Once Per Game — Charm:** Target one enemy non-Hero model within 8". It immediately switches sides and activates under your control for 1 round, then is destroyed.

| Level | Global | Dark Ranger Spec | Banshee Spec |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lv.1 | Black Arrow | Silence | Life Drain |
| Lv.2 | Hunter's Mark | Dark Pursuit | Wail of the Banshee |
| Lv.3 | — | **Withering Volley** | **Possession** |

**Ability Definitions:**
- **Black Arrow** *(2 Mana — Buff, self):* Until end of round, this Hero's ranged attacks apply **Shadow Wound** to targets hit. Shadow Wound: the target suffers -1 DEF and cannot be healed or use Regeneration until end of next round.
- **Hunter's Mark** *(1 Mana — Debuff):* Target enemy within 18" suffers -1 DEF until end of round. All friendly Forsaken models gain +1 to hit against the marked target.
- **Silence** *(2 Mana — Debuff):* Target enemy within 12" cannot use abilities until end of round.
- **Dark Pursuit** *(1 Mana — Buff, self):* Gain Stealth and Disengage until this Hero attacks.
- **Withering Volley** *(Once Per Battle — 3 Mana):* Small Blast (3"), STR 5, Range 24". All models hit suffer -1 TGH for the rest of the game.
- **Life Drain** *(2 Mana — Spell Shoot):* Range 12", STR 4. This Hero heals WND equal to wounds dealt (bypasses Undead healing restriction).
- **Wail of the Banshee** *(2 Mana — Instant):* All enemies within 4" must immediately take a Morale test at -2. Undead/Mechanical are immune.
- **Possession** *(Once Per Battle — 3 Mana):* Target one enemy non-Hero model within 6". It permanently switches sides. Its original owner loses the model.

### Grand Apothecary *(Forsaken Hero)*
**Tier:** Hero | **Archetype:** Plague Caster / Debuff Commander
**Keywords:** Magical, Plague
**Specs:** Plague Doctor or Blightcaller
**Allowed Equipment:** Staff, Dagger, Robes/None

| MOV | ATK | SKL | STR | TGH | DEF | INI | WND | PTS |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5 | 2 | 4+ | 3 | 3 | 5+ | 3 | 3 | 120 |

The supreme alchemist of the Royal Apothecary Society. A master of chemical warfare who turns the battlefield itself into a weapon. Every round the fight continues, the enemy gets weaker — stats eroded by plague, ground poisoned by Blight, lungs choked by miasma. Living (not Undead) — the Apothecaries need functioning minds and hands to brew their concoctions. Tests Morale, but can be healed normally.

**Racial — Plague Mastery:** Blight tokens placed by this Hero persist for 3 rounds instead of 2.
**Once Per Game — New Plague:** Large Blast (5"), Range 12". All enemy models hit suffer -1 TGH AND -1 ATK for the rest of the game. No damage roll, no save — pure debilitation.

| Level | Global | Plague Doctor Spec | Blightcaller Spec |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lv.1 | Plague Bomb | Toxic Injection | Blight Spray |
| Lv.2 | Miasma | Adaptive Toxin | Creeping Death |
| Lv.3 | — | **Perfected Strain** | **Wrathgate** |

**Ability Definitions:**
- **Plague Bomb** *(2 Mana — Blast):* Small Blast (3"), Range 12", STR 3. Creates a Blight token at the impact point.
- **Miasma** *(1 Mana — Debuff):* All enemies within 3" of this Hero suffer -1 to hit rolls until end of round.
- **Toxic Injection** *(1 Mana — Buff):* Target one friendly model within 6". Its melee attacks apply Poison this round. *(Poison: target suffers 1 wound at the start of its next activation, DEF save allowed.)*
- **Adaptive Toxin** *(2 Mana — Debuff):* Target enemy within 12" suffers -1 TGH until end of round. If the target is already affected by Poison or Blight, it also suffers -1 ATK.
- **Blight Spray** *(1 Mana — Spell Shoot):* Range 8", STR 3. Creates a Blight token at the target's position.
- **Creeping Death** *(2 Mana — Instant):* All existing Blight tokens on the battlefield detonate — every enemy model within 2" of any Blight token suffers 1 automatic wound (DEF save allowed). Blight tokens are not removed.
- **Perfected Strain** *(Once Per Battle — 3 Mana):* Target enemy model within 12". It suffers -2 TGH, -1 ATK, and -1 DEF for the rest of the game. No save.
- **Wrathgate** *(Once Per Battle — 4 Mana):* Large Blast (5"), Range 18", STR 5. Creates Blight tokens across the entire blast area. Friendly models caught in the blast are also affected (the New Plague doesn't discriminate).

## BASELINE

---

### Deathguard
**Tier:** Baseline | **Archetype:** Core Infantry
**Keywords:** Undead

| MOV | ATK | SKL | STR | TGH | DEF | INI | WND | PTS |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5 | 2 | 4+ | 3 | 3 | 5+ | 3 | 2 | 35 |

The rank-and-file soldiers of Undercity. Former humans risen in undeath, they retain their martial training. Undead keyword means they never break but can never heal — a trade-off that defines the Forsaken playstyle. Average stats but relentless, since they fight without fear or hesitation.

**Allowed Equipment:** Sword, Axe, Shield, Mail, Leather

---

### Plague Spreader
**Tier:** Baseline | **Archetype:** Debuff Ranged
**Keywords:** Undead, Plague

| MOV | ATK | SKL | STR | TGH | DEF | INI | WND | PTS |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5 | 2 | 4+ | 3 | 3 | 6+ | 3 | 2 | 40 |

**Ranged:** Plague Vial 12", Ranged STR 3

The cheapest debuff unit in the game. They hurl vials of concentrated plague at short range. When a Plague Vial wounds a target, it also applies -1 TGH until end of round. No other faction can degrade enemy stats from a Baseline unit — this is what makes Forsaken fundamentally different. Expendable and Undead, they keep throwing plague until they're cut down.

**Allowed Equipment:** Plague Vial (ranged), Dagger, Leather

**Plague Vial:** When this model's ranged attack deals at least 1 unsaved wound, the target suffers -1 TGH until end of round.

---

## MOUNTED

---

### Dread Rider
**Tier:** Mounted | **Archetype:** Pursuit Cavalry
**Keywords:** Undead, Fear

| MOV | ATK | SKL | STR | TGH | DEF | INI | WND | PTS |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8 | 3 | 4+ | 4 | 4 | 5+ | 3 | 3 | 65 |

Undead knights on skeletal warhorses. Not shock cavalry — they don't hit with the explosive charge of Wolf Riders or Knights of the Silver Hand. Instead, they're relentless pursuers who terrify the living. Medium speed, medium toughness, Fear aura. The sight of dead riders bearing down on you tests the nerve of even veteran soldiers. Undead means they never flee and cannot be healed.

**Allowed Equipment:** Sword, Lance, Shield, Mail

**Dread Charge:** When this model charges an enemy, the target must immediately pass a Morale test or suffer -1 to all hit rolls on its next activation. Undead/Mechanical are immune.

---

## ELITE

---

### Dark Ranger
**Tier:** Elite | **Archetype:** Elite Ranged / Sniper
**Keywords:** Undead, Stealth, Decisive Blow [1], Precision Shot

| MOV | ATK | SKL | STR | TGH | DEF | INI | WND | PTS |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 6 | 3 | 2+ | 3 | 3 | 6+ | 5 | 2 | 75 |

**Ranged:** Longbow 24", Ranged STR 4

The most accurate ranged unit in the game. SKL 2+ means almost every arrow finds its mark — centuries of undead existence have honed their aim to supernatural precision. Stealth keeps them hidden beyond 12" until the killing begins. Precision Shot lets them pick targets out of melee. Decisive Blow [1] punishes on natural 6s. Fragile in close combat, but if you can't find them, you can't fight them.

**Allowed Equipment:** Longbow, Dagger, Leather

---

### Deathstalker
**Tier:** Elite | **Archetype:** Melee Assassin
**Keywords:** Undead, Stealth, Disengage

| MOV | ATK | SKL | STR | TGH | DEF | INI | WND | PTS |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 6 | 3 | 3+ | 3 | 3 | 6+ | 6 | 2 | 70 |

Forsaken rogues and spies. They slip in under Stealth, strike with poisoned blades, and Disengage out before the enemy can retaliate. Glass cannon — high INI and Stealth make them hard to pin down, but if caught in a fair fight they die fast. Their Poison is unique to the Forsaken — the only persistent melee damage-over-time in the game.

**Allowed Equipment:** Dagger (x2), Leather

**Poison:** When this model's melee attack deals at least 1 unsaved wound, the target suffers 1 additional wound at the start of its next activation (DEF save allowed).

---

### Abomination
**Tier:** Elite | **Archetype:** Heavy Tank / Control
**Keywords:** Undead, Cleave, Fear

| MOV | ATK | SKL | STR | TGH | DEF | INI | WND | PTS |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4 | 3 | 4+ | 5 | 5 | 4+ | 1 | 5 | 90 |

Stitched-together corpse monstrosities. Massive WND pool, high TGH, Heavy Armor — the Forsaken's answer to needing a front line that doesn't fold. Slow and stupid but horrifyingly effective. Cleave sweeps through clusters. Fear tests enemy morale. The Meat Hook is unique to Abominations — a forced repositioning tool that drags enemies out of position and into the kill zone. No other unit in the game can forcibly move an enemy.

**Allowed Equipment:** Cleaver (Heavy Weapon), Meat Hook, Plate Armor

**Meat Hook** *(Free, once per activation):* Target one enemy model within 6" and Line of Sight. Roll a D6: on 3+, move the target into base contact with this model. The target counts as having been charged (the Abomination may fight it immediately). On 1–2, the hook misses.

---

### Apothecary
**Tier:** Elite | **Archetype:** Plague Support / Caster
**Keywords:** Magical, Plague

| MOV | ATK | SKL | STR | TGH | DEF | INI | WND | PTS |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5 | 2 | 4+ | 3 | 3 | 6+ | 3 | 2 | 55 |

Royal Apothecary Society alchemists. Deploy Blight tokens, brew toxins, and spread plague. Living (not Undead) — the Apothecaries need functioning minds and steady hands to brew their concoctions. Tests Morale, but can be healed. Their Plague keyword synergizes with the Blight faction mechanic, creating zones of area denial that weaken and wound enemies over time.

**Allowed Equipment:** Dagger, Staff, Leather, Robes/None

**Plague Deployment** *(Free, once per activation):* Place a Blight token within 3" of this model.

---

### Val'kyr
**Tier:** Elite | **Archetype:** Shadow Support / Flyer
**Keywords:** Undead, Fly, Magical

| MOV | ATK | SKL | STR | TGH | DEF | INI | WND | PTS |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8 | 2 | 4+ | 3 | 3 | 6+ | 5 | 3 | 85 |

Former servants of the Lich King, now sworn to the Dark Lady. The Val'kyr are the only models in the entire game that can heal Undead — a power that fundamentally changes how the Forsaken play. As long as a Val'kyr lives, your Undead models can recover wounds. Killing the Val'kyr shuts down this lifeline, making her the highest-priority target in any Forsaken army. Fragile and not a fighter, but her support abilities are irreplaceable.

**Allowed Equipment:** None (shadow magic only)

**Shadow Mend** *(2 Mana — Instant):* Target one friendly Undead model within 6". It recovers 2 lost WND. *(This explicitly overrides the Undead "cannot be healed" restriction. Val'kyr Shadow Mend is the only ability in the game that can heal Undead models.)*

**Dark Empowerment** *(1 Mana — Buff):* Target one friendly model within 6". It gains +1 ATK die until end of round.

## FORSAKEN DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

**Scourge raises the dead. Forsaken breaks the living.**

The Forsaken don't flood the board with disposable skeletons — that's the Scourge's game. Instead, every round that passes makes the enemy weaker:

- **Round 1–2:** Plague Spreaders and Blight tokens start degrading enemy TGH. Deathstalkers infiltrate under Stealth.
- **Round 3–4:** Adaptive Toxin and Hunter's Mark stack debuffs. The enemy is hitting softer, saving worse, moving through poisoned ground.
- **Round 5–6:** The cumulative debuff damage is catastrophic. What was once a TGH 5 Tauren is now TGH 3 and bleeding from Poison.

**The Undead/Living split:** Undead models (Deathguard, Dark Ranger, Abomination, Dread Rider, Deathstalker, Val'kyr, Dark Lady) never break but never heal — unless the Val'kyr lives. Living models (Apothecary, Grand Apothecary) can be healed but test Morale. Protecting your Val'kyr is critical.

**Unique mechanics no other faction has:**
- **Blight** — persistent area denial tokens
- **Plague Vial debuff** — stat degradation from Baseline ranged
- **Poison** — damage-over-time from melee
- **Meat Hook** — forced enemy repositioning
- **Shadow Mend** — the only way to heal Undead in the game
- **Charm / Possession** — turning enemies against themselves
