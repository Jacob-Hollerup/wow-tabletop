# AZEROTH AT WAR — Army Book: HUMANS (Stormwind)
## Version 0.1 (Unit List & Archetypes)

*For the Alliance!*

---

## FACTION IDENTITY

**Theme:** Disciplined, versatile, faith-powered. The backbone of the Alliance.

**Playstyle:** Balanced and adaptable. Strong defensive line with heavy armor infantry, supported by paladins (Taunt/healing) and priests (buffs). Solid ranged with crossbowmen. Good cavalry for flanking. No glaring weakness but no extreme specialty either — they win through discipline and flexibility.

**Faction Mechanic — Devotion Auras:** Buff abilities cast by Human models cost **1 less Mana** (minimum 1). Represents the inspiring faith and discipline of Stormwind.

## HEROES

*Human Heroes are preset profiles. Choose a Hero type, pick a spec, and choose a level (1–3). Each Hero has a racial ability, a once-per-game ability, and abilities gained by level.*

## BASELINE

---

### Footman
**Tier:** Baseline | **Archetype:** Core Infantry
**Keywords:** Spell Block

The Alliance backbone. Plate armor and shield make them the toughest baseline unit to wound (DEF 4+). Spell Block interrupts enemy casters in melee. Not fast, not flashy — just an immovable wall.

| MOV | ATK | SKL | STR | TGH | DEF | INI | WND |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5 | 2 | 4+ | 4 | 4 | 4+ | 3 | 2 |

**Allowed Equipment:** Sword, Greatsword, Halberd, Shield, Plate Armor, Mail

---

### Crossbowman
**Tier:** Baseline | **Archetype:** Core Ranged
**Keywords:** —

Stormwind's ranged infantry. Reliable and disciplined, these soldiers hold the line at distance. Not as powerful as Dwarven rifles or as agile as Elven archers, but they're cheap, accurate enough, and field in numbers. Standard 24" range crossbows provide solid fire support.

| MOV | ATK | SKL | STR | TGH | DEF | INI | WND |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5 | 2 | 4+ | 3 | 3 | 5+ | 3 | 2 |

**Ranged:** Crossbow 24", Ranged STR 4

**Allowed Equipment:** Crossbow, Sword, Dagger, Mail, Leather

---

## MOUNTED

---

### Knight
**Tier:** Mounted | **Archetype:** Heavy Cavalry
**Keywords:** Momentum [1]

Classic armored charge. High DEF, solid damage on impact. The hammer to the Footman's anvil.

**Allowed Equipment:** Sword, Halberd, Shield, Plate Armor, Mail

---

## ELITE

---

### Novice Mage
**Tier:** Elite | **Archetype:** Caster / Support
**Keywords:** Magical

Apprentice spellcaster. Basic arcane damage and one cheap buff. Fragile but provides Magical keyword for Mana generation.

**Allowed Equipment:** Staff, Dagger, Robes/None

---
