# AZEROTH AT WAR — Army Book: TAUREN (Thunder Bluff)
## Version 0.1 (Unit List & Archetypes)

*Earth Mother, guide my hand.*

---

## FACTION IDENTITY

**Theme:** Mighty, spiritual, nature-guardians. Walking walls of muscle.

**Playstyle:** Elite-heavy, low model count. Every Tauren model is big, tough, and hits hard. Highest base TGH and WND in the game but also the most expensive per model. Cleave keyword is common — their massive weapons sweep through clusters. Totem mechanics for area buffs. They don't have many models, but each one is a serious threat. Sunwalkers (Tauren paladins) provide Taunt and healing.

**Faction Mechanic — War Stomp:** Once per round, one Tauren model may declare War Stomp during its activation. All enemy models within 2" suffer -1 to hit on their next activation (they're staggered). Free, no Mana cost.

## HEROES

*Tauren Heroes are preset profiles. Choose a Hero type, pick a spec, and choose a level (1–3). Each Hero has a racial ability, a once-per-game ability, and abilities gained by level.*

### Elder Shaman *(Tauren Hero)*
**Tier:** Hero | **Archetype:** Caster / Tank
**Keywords:** Magical, Summon [3]
**Specs:** Elemental or Restoration
**Allowed Equipment:** Staff, Mace, Shield, Chain/Hide

Earth magic incarnate. The toughest caster in the game — Tauren stats mean this Hero can take hits while channeling. War Stomp disrupts melee engagements. Summon Earth Elemental provides a durable frontline summon.

**Racial — War Stomp:** Once per round, after this Hero's activation, all enemies within 2" suffer -1 to hit on their next activation. Free, no Mana.
**Once Per Game — Reincarnation:** When this Hero is destroyed, return to play at the start of the next Morale Phase with half WND (rounded up) at the same position.

## BASELINE

---

### Brave
**Tier:** Baseline | **Archetype:** Core Infantry
**Keywords:** Cleave

The rank-and-file warriors of Thunder Bluff. Even Tauren Baseline troops are enormous — higher TGH and WND than most factions' Elites. Cleave lets their massive weapons sweep through multiple enemies. Slow and predictable, but incredibly hard to bring down.

| MOV | ATK | SKL | STR | TGH | DEF | INI | WND |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5 | 2 | 4+ | 5 | 5 | 5+ | 2 | 4 |

**Allowed Equipment:** War Totem, Greataxe, Mace, Shield, Chain/Hide

---

## MOUNTED

---

*(Tauren have no Mounted units — they are their own cavalry. Kodo Beasts may be introduced as Monster-tier in future updates.)*

---

## ELITE

---

### Tauren Warrior
**Tier:** Elite | **Archetype:** Heavy Infantry
**Keywords:** Cleave

Massive, tough, devastating. Higher TGH and WND than anything else in the Horde roster. Cleave sweeps through enemies. Slow but hits like a truck. The anvil around which battles are won.

| MOV | ATK | SKL | STR | TGH | DEF | INI | WND |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5 | 3 | 4+ | 5 | 6 | 4+ | 2 | 4 |

**Allowed Equipment:** War Totem, Greataxe, Mace, Shield, Chain/Hide, Heavy Mail

---

### Sunwalker
**Tier:** Elite | **Archetype:** Tank / Support
**Keywords:** Taunt, Magical

Tauren paladins — followers of An'she, the sun. Combine Tauren toughness with holy healing and Taunt. The living shield of Thunder Bluff. Even harder to kill than a standard Tauren Warrior thanks to self-healing, and Taunt forces enemies to deal with them.

**Allowed Equipment:** Mace, Shield, Heavy Mail, Chain/Hide

## COMPOSITION GUIDELINES *(to be finalized)*

| Standard (750 pts) | 3–5 | 0 | 1–3 | 1–2 |
| Large (1000+ pts) | 4–7 | 0 | 2–4 | 2–3 |

*Note: Tauren composition limits are lower than other factions to reflect their elite-heavy, low model count nature. Each model costs significantly more points.*
