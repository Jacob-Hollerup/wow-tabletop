# AZEROTH AT WAR — Army Book: DWARVES (Ironforge / Wildhammer)
## Version 0.1 (Unit List & Archetypes)

*Stand yer ground!*

---

## FACTION IDENTITY

**Theme:** Stubborn, heavily armed, ranged firepower and aerial prowess.

**Playstyle:** Ranged-dominant with the best guns and artillery in the game. Extremely tough and stubborn (high Morale bonuses). Slow-moving but devastating at range. Wildhammer Dwarves add gryphon riders and stormhammer throwing. Close combat is functional but not their strength — they want to shoot you to pieces before you reach them.

**Faction Mechanic — Stoneborn Resolve:** Dwarven models add +1 to Morale tests (stacks with Command Aura from other sources). Dwarves almost never break.

## HEROES

*Dwarf Heroes are preset profiles. Choose a Hero type, pick a spec, and choose a level (1–3). Each Hero has a racial ability, a once-per-game ability, and abilities gained by level.*

## BASELINE

---

### Dwarf Ranger
**Tier:** Baseline | **Archetype:** Core Ranged
**Keywords:** Decisive Blow [1]

Sturdy ranged specialists with the hardest-hitting ranged weapons in the game. Dwarven rifles and stormhammers don't require supernatural aim — they just punch through whatever they hit. RSTR 5 means wounds on 3+ against most infantry. Longest base range (30") keeps them shooting before anyone else.

| MOV | ATK | SKL | STR | TGH | DEF | INI | WND |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4 | 2 | 4+ | 3 | 4 | 5+ | 3 | 3 |

**Ranged:** Rifle 30", Ranged STR 5

**Allowed Equipment:** Rifle, Crossbow, Stormhammer, Dwarven Hammer, Mail, Leather

---

### Ironforge Guard
**Tier:** Baseline | **Archetype:** Core Infantry
**Keywords:** —

The shield wall of Ironforge. Heavily armored Dwarf infantry who hold the line while Rangers shoot over their heads. Slower than Footmen but just as tough, with Dwarven stubbornness keeping them planted. Their job is simple: don't move, don't break, don't die.

| MOV | ATK | SKL | STR | TGH | DEF | INI | WND |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4 | 2 | 4+ | 4 | 5 | 4+ | 2 | 3 |

**Allowed Equipment:** Dwarven Hammer, Shield, Plate Armor, Mail

Veteran Dwarf lord. Heavy weapon, heavy armor, devastating strikes. High WND. Slow but extremely dangerous.

---

### Gryphon Rider
