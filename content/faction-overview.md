---

## ALLIANCE

### 1. HUMANS (Stormwind)
**Theme:** Disciplined, versatile, faith-powered. The backbone of the Alliance.

**Playstyle:** Balanced and adaptable. Strong defensive line with heavy armor infantry, supported by paladins and priests. Solid ranged support and good cavalry for flanking. No glaring weakness but no extreme specialty either — they win through discipline and flexibility.

**Faction Mechanic — Devotion Auras:** Buff abilities cast by Human models cost **1 less Mana** (minimum 1). Represents the inspiring faith and discipline of Stormwind.

**Strengths:** High DEF across the board, efficient buffs, versatile roster.
**Weaknesses:** Low INI (heavy armor everywhere), not much Regeneration or Berserker, predictable.

---

### 2. DWARVES (Ironforge / Wildhammer)
**Theme:** Stubborn, heavily armed, ranged firepower and aerial prowess.

**Playstyle:** Ranged-dominant with the best guns in the game. Extremely tough and stubborn (high Morale bonuses). Slow-moving but devastating at range. Close combat is functional but not their strength — they want to shoot you to pieces before you reach them.

**Faction Mechanic — Stoneborn Resolve:** Dwarven models add **+1 to Morale tests** (stacks with Command Aura from other sources). Dwarves almost never break.

**Strengths:** Hardest-hitting ranged weapons, longest range, highest Morale, tough infantry, gryphon air support.
**Weaknesses:** Slowest faction, limited magic, few Magical units for Mana/Dispel.

---

### 3. NIGHT ELVES (Kaldorei)
**Theme:** Ancient, stealthy, nature-bound. Guerrilla warfare and druidic shapeshifting.

**Playstyle:** Hit-and-run. High INI across the board, Stealth on many units, strong archery. Druids can shapeshift for different roles. They want to control engagement — picking fights on their terms, using forests as home territory, and never letting the enemy pin them down.

**Faction Mechanic — Shadowmeld:** At the start of any round, Night Elf models that did not attack or use abilities last round may gain Stealth until they act.

**Strengths:** Highest INI faction (hard to hit in melee), Stealth everywhere, excellent archers, shapeshifting versatility, forest terrain advantage.
**Weaknesses:** Low DEF (light armor), fragile if caught in the open, few Heavy Armor or Shield models, weak against Armor Piercing.

---

## HORDE

### 4. ORCS (Orgrimmar)
**Theme:** Savage, honorable, shamanic. Brute force meets elemental magic. Sprint across the field and hit like a freight train.

**Playstyle:** Fast and brutal. Highest base MOV of any infantry faction and high STR/ATK across the board. Berserker keyword on many units — Orcs get *stronger* as they take damage. Momentum on more units than any other faction. Shamans provide elemental magic. The Orc game plan is simple: close the gap, crash into their line, and overwhelm with raw aggression. Where Night Elves are fast because they're evasive, Orcs are fast because they sprint at you screaming.

**Faction Mechanic — Blood Fury:** Once per game, during the Mana Phase, the Orc player may declare Blood Fury. All Orc models gain **+1 ATK die** and **+1 MOV** this round.

**Strengths:** Highest raw ATK/STR, fastest infantry, Momentum on core units, Berserker everywhere, devastating charge game, good elemental magic.
**Weaknesses:** Medium armor at best, below-average DEF, short-range shooting, easy to hit (low INI) — they close fast but can't dodge.

---

### 5. TAUREN (Thunder Bluff)
**Theme:** Mighty, spiritual, nature-guardians. Walking walls of muscle.

**Playstyle:** Elite-heavy, low model count. Every Tauren model is big, tough, and hits hard. Highest base TGH and WND in the game but also the most expensive per model. Cleave keyword is common — their massive weapons sweep through clusters. They don't have many models, but each one is a serious threat.

**Faction Mechanic — War Stomp:** Once per round, one Tauren model may declare War Stomp during its activation. All enemy models within 2" suffer **-1 to hit** on their next activation. Free, no Mana cost.

**Strengths:** Toughest models in the game, Cleave everywhere, War Stomp disruption, excellent tanks, totem buffs.
**Weaknesses:** Very low model count (expensive), slow, no flying, limited ranged options, vulnerable to being outnumbered.

---

### 6. FORSAKEN (Undercity)
**Theme:** Cunning, vengeful, plague and shadow. The dead who chose to fight back.

**Playstyle:** Attrition and debuff-focused. Plague mechanics that weaken enemies over time. Some models have Undead keyword (immune to Morale but can't heal), others don't. This split creates interesting army-building choices.

**Faction Mechanic — Blight:** Forsaken models with the Plague keyword can leave Blight tokens on the battlefield when they activate. Enemy models that move through or end their turn on Blight suffer **1 automatic wound** (DEF save allowed). Blight persists for 2 rounds.

**Strengths:** Debuffs that cripple enemy stats, Blight area denial, Stealth assassins, best ranged accuracy in the game, Undead units ignore Morale, strong attrition game.
**Weaknesses:** Low raw damage output (rely on debuffs first), Undead units can't be healed, split Morale mechanics, moderate stats.

---

### 7. DARKSPEAR TROLLS
**Theme:** Voodoo, regeneration, berserker fury, primal savagery.

**Playstyle:** Regeneration and Berserker everywhere. Trolls get tougher to kill as the fight goes on — they heal, they get angry, they hit harder. Powerful voodoo magic provides hexes, wards, and healing. They want prolonged fights — the longer the battle lasts, the more they dominate through attrition and escalating power.

**Faction Mechanic — Voodoo Shuffle:** Darkspear models that pass a Morale test gain **+1 ATK die** until their next activation. Surviving fear makes them fight harder.

**Strengths:** Regeneration makes them incredibly hard to kill over time, Berserker + Voodoo Shuffle means escalating damage, strong voodoo magic, good mobility.
**Weaknesses:** Light armor across the board (low DEF), vulnerable to burst damage before Regeneration kicks in, no heavy armor or shields, Armor Piercing devastating against them.

---

## SCOURGE

### 8. SCOURGE (Lich King)
**Theme:** Undeath, overwhelming numbers, necromantic power, winter's chill.

**Playstyle:** Swarm and elite. Cheap, expendable Undead flood the board and never test Morale. Behind them, terrifying elites bring devastating power. Necromancers constantly raise more troops. The Scourge doesn't care about losses — every fallen enemy can become a new minion. Frost magic slows and debilitates. They win through relentless, inevitable pressure.

**Faction Mechanic — Raise Dead:** When a non-summoned model (friend OR foe) is destroyed within 6" of a Scourge Magical model, the Scourge player may spend **1 Mana** to place a Skeleton Warrior at the destroyed model's position.

**Strengths:** Entire army immune to Morale, endless summoning/raising, overwhelming activation advantage, Fear on elites, frost debuffs.
**Weaknesses:** Cannot heal (Undead), individual models are weak (except elites), no shields, dependent on Magical units for Mana engine, if casters die the summon engine stops.
