## 1. INTRODUCTION & OVERVIEW

**Azeroth at War** is a tabletop miniatures game for 2 players, pitting the **Horde** against the **Alliance** in tactical battles across the landscapes of Azeroth. Each player commands a warband of 6–15+ units, including powerful Hero units with unique abilities fueled by a shared Mana resource.

**Design Goals:**
- Capture the fantasy of WoW's faction warfare
- Sessions last 1–2 hours
- Simple core rules with depth from Hero abilities and Mana management
- Scalable from skirmishes to large battles

---

## 2. WHAT YOU NEED

- Miniatures or tokens to represent your units (any 28–32mm scale minis work great; WoW-themed or generic fantasy)
- A tape measure or ruler (inches)
- Six-sided dice (D6) — you'll want at least 6–10
- A flat playing surface — 30" × 21" for standard/large battles, or 15" × 10.5" for skirmishes
- Terrain pieces (forests, hills, ruins, water features) with ground markers defining boundaries
- Unit Stat Cards (provided in faction Army Books)
- Mana Tokens (coins, beads, or any small markers — about 10–12 per player)
- A Wound/Damage tracker (dice, tokens, or a notepad)
- Scatter Die and Blast Templates (see Section 8.4)

## 3. SETTING UP THE BATTLEFIELD

### 3.1 Table Size

| Battle Size | Units Per Side | Recommended Table | Army Points |
|---|---|---|---|
| Skirmish | 6–8 | 15" × 10.5" | 500 pts |
| Standard | 9–12 | 30" × 21" | 750 pts |
| Large Battle | 13–18 | 30" × 21" | 1,000+ pts |

### 3.2 Terrain Placement

Terrain layouts use **set maps** — pre-designed terrain configurations provided with each scenario or battle size. Terrain should cover roughly 25–30% of the table for interesting tactical play. Set map supplements will specify exact terrain placement for each scenario.

**Terrain Boundaries:** All terrain features (forests, ruins, water, hills) are defined by **physical markers on the ground** (felt cutouts, drawn boundaries, or marker stones) placed before the game begins. A model is considered "inside" a terrain feature if more than half its base is within the marked boundary.

**Terrain Types:**

- **Open Ground:** No effect on movement or combat.
- **Forests / Dense Brush:** Units inside gain **Soft Cover** (+1 to Defense rolls). Movement through forests costs double (2" of movement per 1" traveled). **Mounted/Cavalry units cannot enter forests** (unless they have the Fly keyword). Flying models may move over or through forests at normal speed; if a flying model ends its move inside a forest, it gains Soft Cover as normal.
- **Ruins / Walls:** Units gain **Hard Cover** (+2 to Defense rolls) against attacks that pass through ruin terrain. Cover is directional — the terrain must be between the attacker and defender. Units cannot move through intact walls; ruined walls cost double movement.
- **Hills / Elevated Ground:** Units on higher ground gain +1 to ranged Attack rolls against lower targets. Moving onto or across a hill costs **1" of extra movement**. **Melee on hills** — see Section 7.5 for detailed hill combat rules.
- **Water (Rivers, Streams):** Shallow water costs double movement. Deep water is impassable unless a unit has a special rule. **Heavy Armor units cannot cross any water terrain** (unless they have the Fly keyword). Flying models may move over any water terrain at normal speed.
- **Impassable Terrain:** Cliffs, lava, deep chasms — units cannot enter. Flying models may move over impassable terrain but cannot end their move on it.

**Flying Models & Terrain:** Models with the **Fly** keyword ignore terrain movement penalties and may move over terrain features and other models. They must still end their move on valid ground. See Section 4.6 (Fly keyword) for full rules.

### 3.3 Deployment

Each player rolls a D6; the higher roller chooses a table edge. Players deploy units within their **deployment zone**, alternating placing one unit at a time, starting with the player who did **not** choose their edge.

| Battle Size | Deployment Zone Depth |
|---|---|
| Skirmish | 3" from table edge |
| Standard | 5" from table edge |
| Large Battle | 6" from table edge |

---

## 4. ARMY BUILDING

Each unit has a **Points Cost**. Players agree on a total points budget before building their armies.

### 4.1 Army Composition Rules

- Every army **must** include at least 1 Hero.
- Each unique Hero may only be taken once.
- The exact number of models allowed per tier depends on the **battle size** and your **faction/force**. Each faction's Army Book will specify composition limits (e.g., how many Elites or Heroes are allowed at each battle size).
- **Dual-slot units:** Some powerful units occupy **two tier slots at once**. This is marked on the unit card as two tiers (e.g., *Tier: Mounted + Elite*). When you include a dual-slot unit in your army, it counts against **both** tiers' limits simultaneously, reflecting the unit's exceptional strength.

### 4.2 Unit Tiers

Every model in the game belongs to one of four **tiers** that determine its role and how many you can field:

**Baseline** — Standard infantry and basic units. The core of any army and the most numerous models on the table.

**Mounted** — Standard mounted units. Faster but with terrain restrictions (cannot enter forests — see Section 6).

**Elite** — Advanced, specialized units. Elite Infantry, Elite Mounted, Elite Monsters, etc. More powerful and more expensive than Baseline or Mounted, with limited slots in your army.

**Hero** — Named or generic hero characters. The most powerful individual models with unique abilities and access to the Mana system.

**Note:** Some units within any tier may be designated as **Heavy Armor** (affects terrain, Initiative, and Armor Piercing — see Sections 4.5 and 6). Some units may also have the **Magical** tag, meaning they contribute to Mana generation and enable Dispels (see Section 8). A unit does not need to be a Hero to be Magical.

### 4.3 Units & Models

In **Azeroth at War**, each unit is a **single model**. Every model moves, fights, and acts independently on the battlefield. There are no squads — your army is a collection of individual warriors, beasts, and heroes.

### 4.4 Unit Profiles

Every unit has the following stats:

| Stat | Abbreviation | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Movement | MOV | Distance in inches the unit can move per turn |
| Attack | ATK | Number of D6 rolled when attacking |
| Skill | SKL | The D6 roll needed to hit (e.g., 3+ means 3, 4, 5, or 6 hits) |
| Strength | STR | Compared against target's Toughness to determine wound rolls |
| Toughness | TGH | Resistance to damage |
| Defense | DEF | D6 roll needed to save against a wound (armor save) |
| Initiative | INI | Base Initiative value — represents agility and evasiveness (see Section 7.2) |
| Wounds | WND | How much damage the unit can take before being destroyed |
| Points | PTS | Army building cost |

Base sizes are defined on each unit's card. Larger models are easier to spot behind terrain; smaller models can hide more effectively.

### 4.5 Equipment Tags

Each model's profile includes **equipment tags** that affect Initiative and other rules:

**Armor Class:**
- **Heavy Armor** (HA) — Plate, thick mail. -1 Initiative. Cannot cross water terrain. Retains DEF save against Armor Piercing attacks.
- **Medium Armor** (MA) — Chain, leather reinforced. No Initiative modifier.
- **Light Armor / None** (LA) — Cloth, leather, robes, or unarmored. +1 Initiative.

**Weapon Tags:**
- **Light Weapon** (LW) — Daggers, staves, short swords, claws. +1 Initiative.
- **Standard Weapon** (SW) — Swords, axes, maces, spears. No modifier.
- **Heavy Weapon** (HW) — Two-handed axes, warhammers, greatswords. **-1 Initiative.** Heavy Weapons have a built-in **Decisive Blow [X]** (minimum [1]) — the X value is listed on the unit's weapon profile.
- **Shield** (SH) — Carried alongside a weapon. No Initiative modifier. Retains DEF save against Armor Piercing attacks (see Section 7.4).
- **Ranged Weapon** (RW) — Bows, guns, thrown weapons. Has a **Range** value in inches and a **Ranged STR** value on the weapon profile. Ranged attacks use the weapon's Ranged STR instead of the model's STR stat. If no Ranged STR is listed, use the model's base STR.

A model's equipment tags are listed on its profile.

### 4.6 Keywords

Some models have **keywords** on their unit card that grant special rules:

- **Momentum [X]** — This model gains +X ATK dice when charging. Typically found on Cavalry/Mounted units and some large Monsters.
- **Spell Block** — This model can attempt to interrupt an enemy spell cast within 2" (see Section 8.6).
- **Magical** — This model is attuned to magic. It generates +1 Mana during the Mana Phase (see Section 8.1). Your army must have at least one surviving Magical model to attempt Dispels or Counterspells (see Section 8.5). Magical Heroes get +1 to Dispel/Counterspell rolls.
- **Decisive Blow [X]** — On a natural 6 to hit in melee or ranged, that attack deals +X bonus damage on top of the normal damage. Represents devastating precision.
- **Cleave** — On a natural 6 to hit in melee, the attack also hits one additional enemy model within 2" of the target (roll to wound and save separately for the extra target). Represents wide, sweeping attacks.
- **Berserker** — When this model is at or below 50% of its starting Wounds, it gains +1 ATK die.
- **Regeneration [X]** — At the start of this model's activation, it recovers X lost Wounds (cannot exceed starting Wounds).
- **Stealth** — This model cannot be targeted by ranged attacks from beyond 12". Enemies must get closer to engage.
- **Fear** — Enemy models within 6" of this model suffer -1 to Morale tests. Multiple Fear effects do not stack.
- **Taunt** — Once per round, after this model completes its activation (including any movement, charges, or attacks), it may declare **Taunt** on one enemy model within 6" and Line of Sight. The target does not need to be engaged with the Taunt model. On the **taunted model's next activation**, it is compelled: if not engaged with the Taunt model, it must charge the Taunt model (Move → Charge → Fight); if it cannot reach, it must move as close as possible and may take no other actions. If already engaged with the Taunt model, it must fight the Taunt model — it cannot choose a different target, use Combat Withdrawal, Rush away, or shoot a different target. Taunt expires after the taunted model completes its forced activation, or if the Taunt model is destroyed. Taunt does not work on models with the Undead/Mechanical keyword. A model can only be affected by one Taunt at a time; a newer Taunt replaces an existing one.
- **Undead / Mechanical** — This model is immune to Morale tests (it never Wavers or Routs) and immune to Taunt. However, it cannot be healed by any means (abilities, Regeneration, etc.). Destroyed is destroyed.
- **Summon [X]** — This model can summon temporary units using abilities on its unit card. Each summoning ability specifies its own Mana cost, range, and what unit is summoned. The **[X] value defines how many rounds** the summoned unit lasts before being removed. Summoning is an ability and follows normal ability rules (one ability per activation, costs Mana). Summoning may end the summoner's activation if the ability specifies. Summoned units count as activations and activate normally during the Activation Phase. Whether a summoned unit can control objectives is defined on the summoned unit's card. If the summoner is destroyed, all their summoned units are immediately removed. Summoned units being removed (by expiring or summoner death) do not trigger Morale tests; summoned units destroyed in combat do trigger Morale tests as normal. A summoner may resummon after previous summons have expired or been destroyed.
- **Disengage** — This model can move out of enemy engagement zones **without** provoking Opportunity Attacks.
- **Fly** — This model moves through the air. It ignores all terrain movement penalties (forests, ruins, water, and hills are treated as open ground for movement). It may move over other models and over impassable terrain, but must end its movement on valid, open ground. Flying models ignore the Mounted restriction on forests and the Heavy Armor restriction on water for movement purposes only — if a flying model lands inside a forest or water feature, the terrain's other rules still apply. Flying models have built-in Disengage (they may leave engagement zones without provoking Opportunity Attacks). Flying models are always considered on higher ground for ranged attacks (+1 to hit against non-flying targets below). If a flying model is **Wavered** (via a failed Morale test), it is **grounded** until its next activation — it loses Fly and must move as a ground unit, subject to normal terrain penalties and restrictions. Once it activates, it regains Fly.
- **Precision Shot** — This model may target enemies that are engaged in melee with friendly models (see Section 7.6). Missed shots risk hitting friendlies.

Additional keywords may appear on unit cards in the Army Books.

## 5. TURN STRUCTURE

The game is played over **6 rounds** (or until a victory condition is met).

### 5.1 Round Structure

Each round has three stages:

**Stage 1 — Mana Phase (simultaneous)**
Both players generate Mana and resolve any start-of-round effects at the same time.

**Stage 2 — Activation Phase (alternating)**
Players take turns activating **one model at a time**. The player who deployed second activates first in Round 1; after that, players roll off at the start of each round (highest D6; reroll ties). Players alternate activations until all models on both sides have been activated. If one player runs out of models to activate, the other player activates their remaining models one at a time.

**Stage 3 — Morale Phase (simultaneous)**
Both players test Morale for any models that qualify. Routing models flee during this phase.

### 5.2 Activating a Model

When you activate a model, it performs **one action sequence** from the following options:

**Move → Shoot** — Move up to MOV, then make a ranged attack (or use a Spell (Shoot) ability).

**Hold → Shoot** — Don't move. Make a ranged attack (or use a Spell (Shoot) ability) with +1 to hit rolls (steady aim).

**Move → Charge → Fight** — Move up to MOV, end in base-to-base contact with an enemy, then fight in melee. Models with the **Momentum [X]** keyword gain +X ATK dice when charging. Models without Momentum may still charge but receive no ATK bonus.

**Rush** — Move up to double MOV. No attacks allowed this activation.

**Fight → Move (Combat Withdrawal)** — A model that is **already engaged** (within 2" of an enemy at the start of its activation) may fight first, then move up to half its MOV away. This **does** provoke an **Opportunity Attack** from the enemy (see Section 6.5). A model that uses Combat Withdrawal **cannot charge** during the move portion — it is purely a withdrawal movement.

**Fight (Hold Ground)** — A model that is already engaged fights in melee and stays in place.

**Fight → Shoot** — A model that is already engaged fights in melee, then makes a ranged attack (or uses a Spell (Shoot) ability) against a **different target** (not the model it is in melee with).

**Important:** A model may **never** attack and then charge in the same activation. Combat Withdrawal movement cannot end in base-to-base contact with any enemy model.

**Abilities:** A model may use **one ability** during its activation. Abilities typed as **Spell (Shoot)** replace the model's normal ranged attack in any action sequence that includes Shoot. A model cannot use a Spell (Shoot) and also make a normal ranged weapon attack in the same activation. See Section 8 for full ability rules.

**Taunt:** After completing its activation, a model with the Taunt keyword may declare Taunt on one enemy within 6" (see Taunt keyword, Section 4.6).

---

## 6. MOVEMENT

### 6.1 Basic Movement

When a model is activated, its movement is part of its action sequence (see Section 5.2). Movement is measured in inches from any point on the model's base to the base's new position.

- **Normal Move:** Up to the model's MOV value in inches.
- **Rush:** Up to double MOV, but the model cannot attack this activation.
- **Combat Withdrawal Move:** Up to half MOV, only after fighting (see 5.2).

### 6.2 Movement Rules

- Models cannot move through other friendly or enemy models (exception: models with the **Fly** keyword may move over other models).
- Models may freely move into and through engagement zones. However, moving **out of** an enemy model's 2" engagement zone provokes an **Opportunity Attack** (see Section 6.5) unless the model has the Disengage or Fly keyword.
- Difficult terrain (forests, ruins, water) costs double movement as noted in Section 3. Hills cost 1" of extra movement. Models with the **Fly** keyword ignore all terrain movement penalties.
- A model using Combat Withdrawal cannot end its move in base-to-base contact with any enemy.

### 6.3 Charging

If a model ends its movement in base-to-base contact with an enemy model, it has **charged**. Models with the **Momentum [X]** keyword gain +X ATK dice when charging. Models without Momentum receive no ATK bonus for charging. A model **cannot charge** during a Combat Withdrawal.

### 6.4 Engagement Zone

Every model has a **2" engagement zone** around it. A model is **engaged** if it is within 2" of an enemy model at the start of its activation. Engaged models cannot freely walk away — they must use Combat Withdrawal (Fight → Move) or have the Disengage/Fly keyword to leave without provoking an Opportunity Attack.

### 6.5 Opportunity Attacks

Whenever a model moves **out of** an enemy's 2" engagement zone, the enemy may immediately make an **Opportunity Attack** — unless the moving model has the **Disengage** or **Fly** keyword.

- The enemy makes a single melee attack (full ATK dice) with **-1 to hit rolls**.
- This is resolved immediately, before the moving model continues.
- If the moving model is destroyed by the Opportunity Attack, its activation ends.
- A model can only make **one Opportunity Attack per round** (it cannot react to every model that leaves its zone).
- **Charging** does not provoke Opportunity Attacks from the target you are charging (you are committing to fight). However, if you pass through a *different* enemy's zone on the way to your charge target, that other enemy may make an Opportunity Attack.

Combat Withdrawal (Fight → Move) also provokes an Opportunity Attack, but the withdrawing model gets to fight first before pulling away.

---

## 7. COMBAT

### 7.1 Ranged Combat

When a model performs a ranged attack (via Move → Shoot, Hold → Shoot, or Fight → Shoot), resolve it as follows:

**Line of Sight (LOS):** Draw an imaginary line from the attacking model's base to any visible part of the target model. If terrain completely blocks the line, there is no LOS and the attack cannot be made. If any part of the target is visible, LOS is established — but the target may benefit from Cover if terrain partially obscures it (see Terrain Types, Section 3.2). Other models (friendly or enemy) do not block Line of Sight.

**To make a ranged attack:**
1. Check **Range** — each ranged weapon has a maximum range in inches. Measure from the attacking model to the target.
2. Check **Line of Sight** — the attacking model must have LOS to the target.
3. **Roll to Hit** — roll a number of D6 equal to the unit's ATK. Each die that meets or exceeds the unit's SKL value is a **hit**.
4. **Roll to Wound** — for each hit, roll a D6 and compare the attacker's STR (use Ranged STR for ranged weapons) to the target's TGH:

| STR vs TGH | D6 Needed to Wound |
|---|---|
| STR is double or more TGH | 2+ |
| STR is greater than TGH | 3+ |
| STR equals TGH | 4+ |
| STR is less than TGH | 5+ |
| STR is half or less TGH | 6+ |

5. **Defense Save** — for each wound, the defending player rolls a D6. If the roll meets or exceeds the unit's DEF, the wound is saved (negated). Cover modifiers apply here.
6. **Apply Damage** — each unsaved wound removes 1 Wound from the target unit. When a unit reaches 0 Wounds, it is destroyed (see Section 7.8).

**Range Bands:**
- Within half range: no modifier
- Beyond half range: -1 to hit rolls

### 7.2 Melee Combat

When a model fights in melee (through a Charge, Fight, Fight → Move, or Fight → Shoot activation), **only the active model attacks.** The defending model does not strike back — it fights only when it is activated by its own player.

#### 7.2.1 Initiative as Evasion

Initiative represents a model's agility and evasiveness in melee. When making a melee attack, compare the attacker's **Effective Initiative** to the defender's **Effective Initiative**:

- If the **defender's** Effective INI is **higher** than the attacker's: the attacker suffers **-1 to hit rolls**.
- If the attacker's Effective INI is **equal to or higher** than the defender's: no modifier.

**Calculating Effective Initiative:**

**Base INI + Armor Modifier + Weapon Modifier + Charge Bonus**

| Modifier | Value |
|---|---|
| Heavy Armor (HA) | -1 |
| Medium Armor (MA) | 0 |
| Light Armor / None (LA) | +1 |
| Light Weapon (LW) | +1 |
| Heavy Weapon (HW) | -1 |
| Charging | +1 |

**Example:** An Orc Grunt (INI 3, MA, SW = Eff. INI 3) charges a Rogue (INI 5, LA, LW = Eff. INI 7). Even with the charge bonus (Eff. INI 4), the Grunt's INI is lower than the Rogue's 7 — the Grunt suffers -1 to hit. The Rogue is too fast.

**Example:** A Knight charging (INI 4, HA -1, SW 0, Charge +1 = Eff. INI 4) attacks a Footman (INI 3, HA -1, SW 0 = Eff. INI 2). Attacker's INI is higher — no modifier. The charge connects cleanly.

#### 7.2.2 Melee Attack Process

1. **Check Initiative** — compare Effective INI as above.
2. **Roll to Hit** — roll ATK dice (plus any Momentum bonus from charging); hits on SKL+ (apply -1 if defender's INI is higher).
3. **Roll to Wound** — compare attacker's STR to target's TGH on the Wound Chart.
4. **Defense Save** — defender rolls DEF saves. Cover bonuses do **not** apply in melee.
5. **Apply Damage** — unsaved wounds remove Wounds from the target.

The defender does **not** strike back. It fights only on its own activation.

#### 7.2.3 Multiple Models in Melee

When multiple models are engaged in a melee, follow these rules:

- **Activating a model engaged with multiple enemies:** The active model chooses **one** enemy within 2" to attack. It cannot split attacks between multiple targets.
- **Multiple friendly models engaged with one enemy:** Each friendly model fights separately on its own activation. The enemy does not strike back — it only fights when activated.
- **Taunt interaction:** If a model is Taunted, it must attack the Taunt model on its activation (see Taunt keyword, Section 4.6).

### 7.3 Modifiers Summary

**Combat Modifiers:**
| Situation | Modifier |
|---|---|
| Charging with Momentum [X] | +X ATK dice |
| Charging downhill with Momentum [X] | +X ATK dice (stacks with downhill bonus) |
| Holding (ranged only) | +1 to hit rolls |
| Elevated (ranged only) | +1 to hit rolls |
| Defender's Effective INI higher (melee only) | -1 to hit rolls |
| Long range (beyond half) | -1 to hit rolls |
| Soft Cover (defender) | +1 DEF |
| Hard Cover (defender) | +2 DEF |
| Defending uphill (melee) | +1 DEF |
| Flanking (melee only) | -1 to defender's DEF |

**Initiative Modifiers:**
| Source | INI Modifier |
|---|---|
| Heavy Armor (HA) | -1 |
| Medium Armor (MA) | 0 |
| Light Armor / None (LA) | +1 |
| Light Weapon (LW) | +1 |
| Heavy Weapon (HW) | -1 |
| Charging | +1 |

### 7.4 Armor Piercing

When an attacker's STR is **double or more** the target's TGH, the attack is so powerful that it can punch through armor entirely.

**Armor Piercing rule:** If STR ≥ 2× TGH, wounds **automatically skip the DEF save** — the target takes the damage with no save allowed. For ranged attacks, use the weapon's Ranged STR for this comparison.

**Exception — Shield (SH) or Heavy Armor (HA):** If the target model has a **Shield** or **Heavy Armor** tag, they may still attempt their DEF save as normal, even against Armor Piercing attacks.

### 7.5 Flanking

Attacking from the side or rear is devastating in melee.

**Front Arc:** Every model has a **180° front arc** — an imaginary line drawn through the center of the base from left to right, with the front being the direction the model is facing. The remaining 180° behind the model is the **rear arc**.

**How to determine flanking:**
1. Draw an imaginary line through the center of the **defender's** base.
2. If the **attacker** is positioned in the defender's **rear arc** at the moment of the attack, the attack is a **flanking attack**.
3. The defender suffers **-1 DEF** against flanking attacks.

**Notes:**
- Flanking applies to **melee attacks only**. Ranged attacks are not affected by the target's facing.
- A model's facing is set when it finishes its movement. Models can be turned freely as part of their movement at no extra cost.
- If there's any doubt whether an attacker is in the front or rear arc, it counts as **front** (benefit of the doubt to the defender).

### 7.6 Shooting into Melee

By default, models **cannot** shoot at a target that is currently engaged in melee (within 2" of a friendly model). The risk of hitting your own troops is too great.

However, models with the **Precision Shot** keyword may fire into melee:

1. Declare the target and roll to hit as normal.
2. For each **miss** (a die that fails the SKL roll), roll a D6:
   - On a **1**, the missed shot hits the closest friendly model engaged with the target instead. Roll to wound and save against the friendly model as normal.
   - On a **2–6**, the shot simply misses.
3. Hits that successfully land are resolved against the intended target as normal.

**Without Precision Shot, pick a different target.**

### 7.7 Hill Combat (Melee)

Fighting on hills gives a significant tactical advantage. Compare the attacker's and defender's positions. A unit is "on the hill" if its base is on elevated terrain. A unit is "below the hill" if its base is on lower ground.

| Situation | Attacker Modifier | Defender Modifier |
|---|---|---|
| Attacker charges **uphill** (attacker below, defender on hill) | No bonus | **+1 DEF** (high ground advantage) |
| Attacker charges **downhill** (attacker on hill, defender below) | **+X ATK dice** (Momentum [X] only) | No bonus |
| Both units on the **same elevation** | No modifier | No modifier |

**Notes:**
- Moving onto or across a hill costs 1" of extra movement.
- The downhill charge bonus is only for models with the Momentum keyword.
- The uphill defender's +1 DEF stacks with any cover bonuses if applicable.
- **Flying models and hills:** A flying model is always considered to be on higher ground for ranged attacks (+1 to hit against non-flying targets below). In melee, a flying model charging a ground unit is treated as charging downhill (gains Momentum [X] bonus if applicable).

### 7.8 When a Model Is Destroyed

When a model is reduced to 0 Wounds, it is **destroyed**. Resolve the following immediately:

1. **Engagement zone vanishes.** The destroyed model's 2" engagement zone ceases to exist immediately. Any models that were engaged with it are no longer engaged and are free to act normally on their next activation.

2. **Summoned units removed.** If the destroyed model had the Summon keyword and had active summoned units on the battlefield, all of its summoned units are immediately removed from play.

3. **Morale trigger.** The destruction triggers Morale tests for friendly models within 6" during the next Morale Phase (as per Section 10.1).

4. **On-death effects.** Some models have abilities that trigger "when this model is destroyed." These are resolved immediately after the model is destroyed, before play continues. On-death effects are defined on the unit's card.

After all destruction effects are resolved, remove the model from the battlefield.

---

## 8. MANA & ABILITIES

The Mana system is what makes **Azeroth at War** feel like Warcraft. Your Heroes and magical units channel energy to unleash powerful abilities on the battlefield.

### 8.1 Mana Generation

At the start of each turn (Mana Phase), you generate Mana:

**Base Mana (by battle size):**
| Battle Size | Base Mana |
|---|---|
| Skirmish | 2 |
| Standard | 3 |
| Large Battle | 4 |

- **Hero Bonus:** Each surviving Hero generates **+1 Mana**.
- **Magical Unit Bonus:** Each surviving non-Hero model with the **Magical** keyword generates **+1 Mana**.
- **Control Points:** Some scenarios grant +1 Mana per controlled objective (see Section 11).
- **Mana Cap:** You can store a maximum of **10 Mana** at any time. Excess is lost.

Track your Mana pool with tokens.

### 8.2 Spending Mana

Mana is spent to activate abilities during a model's activation. Each ability has a Mana cost listed on the model's stat card.

**Who can spend Mana?** Both Heroes and non-Hero models with abilities draw from the same shared Mana pool. The difference is that Heroes typically have more powerful and numerous abilities.

A single model can only use **one ability per activation**. Some abilities are typed as **Spell (Shoot)** — these replace the model's normal ranged attack in any action sequence that includes Shoot (Move → Shoot, Hold → Shoot, Fight → Shoot). A model cannot use a Spell (Shoot) and also make a normal ranged weapon attack in the same activation.

You may activate abilities from multiple different models across the turn, as long as you have the Mana.

### 8.3 Ability Types

Abilities fall into these categories:

- **Instant:** Resolved immediately when activated.
- **Spell (Shoot):** A damage-dealing ability that replaces the model's ranged attack in a Shoot action sequence. Benefits from Hold → Shoot's +1 to hit if applicable.
- **Buff/Aura:** Affects friendly units within range. Lasts until the **end of the current round**.
- **Debuff:** Affects enemy units within range. Lasts until the **end of the current round**.
- **Reaction:** Triggered when an enemy model moves out of the reacting model's 2" engagement zone. Resolved immediately, before the moving model continues. A model may use a Reaction ability and make an Opportunity Attack in response to the same trigger (if it has both available), but each is limited to once per round.
- **Blast:** Area-of-effect spells that use the Scatter & Template system (see 8.4).

Ability range, targeting, and costs are defined on each unit's card.

### 8.4 Scatter Dice & Blast Templates

Many offensive spells and some abilities are **Blast** attacks — they target an area rather than a single unit.

**What You Need:**
- A **Scatter Die** — a six-sided die marked with arrows on 4 faces and a "HIT" symbol on 2 faces (mark a D6: 1–2 = HIT, 3–6 = arrow pointing in a direction)
- A **D6** for scatter distance
- **Blast Templates** — circular templates:
  - **Small Blast (3" diameter)** — focused spells
  - **Large Blast (5" diameter)** — devastating area spells

Each Blast ability on a unit's stat card will specify which template size it uses.

**How to Resolve a Blast Attack:**

1. **Declare Target Point:** The caster picks a target point on the battlefield within the spell's range. Place the center of the appropriate blast template over that point.

2. **Roll to Scatter:** Roll the Scatter Die and a D6 simultaneously.
   - **HIT result:** The blast lands on target. Skip to step 4.
   - **Arrow result:** The blast scatters in the direction the arrow points.

3. **Determine Scatter Distance:** Move the template's center point a number of inches equal to the D6 roll, in the direction the arrow points.
   - *Skilled Casters:* If the casting model has SKL 2+ or 3+, reduce the scatter distance by 1" (minimum 1").

4. **Determine Hits:** Any unit (friend or foe!) that has any part of its base under the template is hit. For each unit under the template, roll to wound using the spell's STR value. No hit roll is needed — the template determines who is hit.

5. **Resolve Wounds:** Roll on the Wound Chart (STR vs TGH) for each unit hit. Defenders roll DEF saves as normal. Cover applies if the unit is behind hard cover relative to the blast center.

**Blast & Friendly Fire:** Blasts do not discriminate. If the template scatters onto your own units, they are hit just like enemy units. Position your troops carefully!

### 8.5 Dispelling & Counterspelling

Dispelling and Counterspelling are only available if your army contains at least one surviving model with the **Magical** tag.

**Dispel (Buffs/Debuffs):** When an enemy activates a Buff or Debuff ability, you may spend **2 Mana** to attempt a Dispel. Roll a D6:
- On a **4+**, the ability is canceled and has no effect (the enemy's Mana is still spent).
- On a **1–3**, the Dispel fails and your 2 Mana is wasted.

**Counterspell (Instant/Blast):** When an enemy activates an Instant or Blast ability, you may spend **3 Mana** to attempt a Counterspell. Roll a D6:
- On a **4+**, the spell is canceled before it resolves (the enemy's Mana is still spent).
- On a **1–3**, the Counterspell fails and the spell goes off as normal.

Magical Heroes add **+1** to Dispel and Counterspell rolls. Non-Hero Magical models roll without this bonus.

**No Magical models = no Dispels or Counterspells.** If all your Magical models are destroyed, you lose both abilities for the rest of the game.

### 8.6 Spell Block (Interrupt)

Some models have the **Spell Block** keyword. A model with Spell Block can attempt to interrupt an enemy spell if the caster is within the model's **2" engagement zone**.

**How Spell Block works:**

1. An enemy model within 2" declares a spell or ability.
2. The model with Spell Block declares an interrupt before the spell is resolved.
3. Roll a D6:
   - On a **4+**, the spell is blocked and has no effect. The caster's Mana is still spent.
   - On a **1–3**, the block fails and the spell goes off as normal.
4. A model can only attempt one Spell Block per round.

**Spell Block vs Counterspell:** Both can be attempted against the same spell. Spell Block is resolved first. If it succeeds, no Counterspell is needed.

## 9. HERO UNITS

### 9.1 Hero Rules

- Heroes are single models with higher stats than regular units.
- Heroes have a **Command Aura** of 6" — friendly models within 6" may reroll one failed Morale test per turn. **A Hero's Command Aura does not apply to itself** — a Hero cannot reroll its own Morale tests using its own aura (though it can benefit from a *different* Hero's Command Aura).
- If your last Hero is slain, your army immediately suffers -1 to all Morale tests for the rest of the game.

### 9.2 Unit Profiles

Unit profiles (including Heroes, Infantry, Cavalry, and Monsters) will be provided in separate **Army Book** supplements for each faction. Each unit card will list the model's stats, base size, equipment tags, keywords, and abilities.

---

## 10. MORALE

When a model takes significant damage or sees allies fall, its resolve may break.

### 10.1 When to Test

A model must take a **Morale Test** during the Morale Phase if:
- It lost 50% or more of its starting Wounds this turn, OR
- A friendly model was destroyed within 6" this turn.

### 10.2 How to Test

Roll 2D6. You must roll **equal to or under** the model's **Morale Value**.

**Morale Values:**
| Tier | Base Morale |
|---|---|
| Baseline | 7 |
| Mounted | 7 |
| Elite | 8 |
| Hero | 9 |

**Modifiers:**
- Within a Hero's Command Aura (not the Hero's own): +1 Morale (reroll one failure)
- Last Hero slain: -1 Morale (permanent for rest of game)
- Model is below 25% starting Wounds: -1 Morale
- Enemy model with Fear within 6": -1 Morale

### 10.3 Morale Results

- **Pass:** The unit holds firm. No effect.
- **Fail by 1–2: Waver.** On its next activation, the model may only Hold → Shoot or Fight (Hold Ground). It cannot Move, Rush, Charge, or use Combat Withdrawal.
- **Fail by 3+: Rout.** The model immediately flees — it moves its full MOV directly toward its own deployment edge. This move does not count as an activation. Enemy models it passes within 2" may make Opportunity Attacks. If the fleeing model reaches the table edge, it is removed from play. If it survives to the next Morale Phase, it may test Morale again — on a pass, it **Rallies** (returns to Wavering status and activates normally next round). On a fail, it continues fleeing toward the table edge. Routing models cannot activate normally — they do not get an activation during the Activation Phase.

**Grounding:** Flying models that Waver are grounded (see Fly keyword, Section 4.6). Flying models that Rout flee on the ground.

## 11. WINNING THE GAME

Before the game begins, players agree on a **scenario**. Here are three core scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Annihilation
Destroy the enemy army. The game ends when one player has no units remaining, or after 6 rounds. If both players have surviving units after 6 rounds, the player who destroyed the most enemy points wins. If tied on points destroyed, the player with the most surviving Wounds across all models wins. If still tied, the game is a draw.

### Scenario 2: Hold the Line (Objectives)
Place 3 objective markers along the center line of the table (perpendicular to the deployment edges). Place one in the exact center of the table, and the other two halfway between the center and each short edge. At the end of each round, a player **controls** an objective if they have a unit within 3" and the enemy does not. At the end of Round 6, each objective is worth **100 Victory Points**. Additionally, each destroyed enemy unit is worth its PTS cost in Victory Points. Highest total wins.

*For Skirmish maps (15" × 10.5"):* Use only 2 objectives, placed along the center line, each 3.5" from the short edges.

*Bonus:* Controlling an objective during your Mana Phase grants +1 Mana per objective.

### Scenario 3: Assassination
Each player secretly nominates one of their Heroes as their **Warlord**. The game ends immediately when a Warlord is slain. That player loses. If the game goes 6 rounds without a Warlord dying, victory is determined by remaining army points.

## 12. QUICK REFERENCE

### Round Sequence
1. **Mana Phase** (simultaneous) — Generate Mana (base + Heroes + Magical units + objectives).
2. **Activation Phase** (alternating) — Players take turns activating 1 model each.
3. **Morale Phase** (simultaneous) — Test models that lost 50%+ Wounds or had allies destroyed nearby. Routing models flee.

### Activation Options
- **Move → Shoot** — Move up to MOV, then ranged attack or Spell (Shoot)
- **Hold → Shoot** — No move, ranged attack or Spell (Shoot) at +1 to hit
- **Move → Charge → Fight** — Move into contact, melee (+X ATK dice if Momentum [X])
- **Rush** — Double MOV, no attacks
- **Fight → Move** (engaged only) — Melee first, then move half MOV away (provokes Opportunity Attack)

### Combat Sequence
1. **Ranged:** Check Range → Check LOS → Roll ATK dice (hits on SKL+) → Wound → DEF Save → Damage
2. **Melee:** Compare Effective INI → Roll ATK dice (hits on SKL+, -1 if defender's INI is higher) → Wound → DEF Save → Damage
3. **Defender does NOT strike back.** Only the active model attacks.

### Opportunity Attacks

- Disengage or Fly keyword = no Opportunity Attacks

### Initiative (Evasion)
- Defender's Effective INI higher than attacker's = **-1 to hit** (melee only)
