# Fly Keyword — Draft Rules Addition

*For insertion into Azeroth at War Core Rulebook v1.0*

---

## 1. KEYWORD ENTRY (Section 4.6)

Insert after the **Disengage** keyword entry:

> **Fly** — This model moves through the air. It ignores **all terrain movement penalties** (forests, ruins, water, and hills are all treated as open ground for movement purposes). It may move **over** other models (friendly and enemy) and over impassable terrain, but it **must end its movement on valid, open ground** — it cannot end its move on top of another model or hovering over impassable terrain. Flying models also ignore the Mounted restriction on forests and the Heavy Armor restriction on water for **movement purposes only** — if a flying model **lands inside** a forest or water feature (ends its move there), the terrain's other rules still apply normally (e.g., it would gain Soft Cover in a forest, or be affected by water if it has Heavy Armor and chooses to land there).
>
> **Engagement & Combat:** Flying models fight in melee and are targeted by ranged attacks using the normal rules — all models can attack them, and they have standard engagement zones. Being airborne does not protect them from ground-based attacks. However, flying models have the **Disengage** ability built in — they may leave enemy engagement zones without provoking Opportunity Attacks.
>
> **Grounding:** If a flying model is **Wavered** (via a failed Morale test), it is **grounded** until its next activation — it loses the Fly keyword and must move as a ground unit for its next activation (subject to normal terrain penalties and restrictions). Once it activates, it regains Fly.
>
> Represents winged creatures and flying mounts — Gryphon Riders, Wind Riders, Hippogryph Riders, Gargoyles, Dragonhawks, Frost Wyrms.

## 2. TERRAIN SECTION UPDATE (Section 3.2)

Add a note to the general terrain rules:

> **Flying Models & Terrain:** Models with the **Fly** keyword ignore terrain movement penalties and may move over terrain features and other models (see Section 4.6, Fly keyword). They must still end their move on valid ground.

Update specific terrain entries with brief Fly callouts:

- **Forests / Dense Brush:** Add at end: *"Flying models may move over or through forests at normal speed. If a flying model ends its move inside a forest, it gains Soft Cover as normal."*
- **Water (Rivers, Streams):** Add at end: *"Flying models may move over any water terrain at normal speed."*
- **Impassable Terrain:** Change to: *"Cliffs, lava, deep chasms — units cannot enter. Flying models may move over impassable terrain but cannot end their move on it."*

## 3. MOVEMENT SECTION UPDATE (Section 6.2)

Add a bullet:

> - Models with the **Fly** keyword ignore terrain movement penalties, may move over other models and impassable terrain, and may leave engagement zones without provoking Opportunity Attacks (they have built-in Disengage). They must still end their move on valid, open ground.

---

## 4. TERRAIN RESTRICTIONS QUICK REF UPDATE (Section 12)

Change to:

> ### Terrain Restrictions Quick Ref
> - **Heavy Armor:** Cannot cross water terrain (unless the model also has Fly)
> - **Mounted/Cavalry:** Cannot enter forests (unless the model also has Fly)
> - **Fly:** Ignores all terrain movement penalties; can move over models and impassable terrain; must land on valid ground; built-in Disengage; grounded while Wavered

---

## 5. KEYWORDS QUICK REF UPDATE (Section 12)

Add to the keywords list:

> - **Fly** — Ignores terrain movement penalties; moves over models and impassable terrain; must end on valid ground; built-in Disengage; grounded when Wavered

---

## 6. HILL COMBAT INTERACTION (Section 7.7)

Add a note:

> **Flying models and hills:** A flying model is always considered to be on higher ground for the purpose of ranged attacks (+1 to hit against non-flying targets below). In melee, a flying model charging a ground unit is treated as **charging downhill** (gains Momentum [X] bonus if applicable). A ground unit charging a flying model that is landed on a hill defends as normal (the flying model is not considered to have extra elevation beyond the hill itself).

---

## 7. DESIGN NOTES

**Why Fly = better movement, not damage immunity:**
The core design intent is that flying is a mobility advantage, not a defensive one. All units can hit flying models — archers shoot them, spearmen stab when they swoop in, mages blast them. This keeps Fly from being oppressive and means every army has counterplay. The power of Fly is:

1. **Terrain freedom** — forests, water, ruins, walls are all irrelevant for pathfinding
2. **Built-in Disengage** — hit-and-run tactics; fly in, fight, fly out next turn without Opportunity Attacks
3. **Positioning** — can cross enemy lines to flank, contest objectives, or reach backline casters
4. **Hill advantage** — treated as elevated for ranged, and charging downhill equivalent for melee

**Grounding on Waver** is the key balancing mechanic — it means Fear, morale pressure, and focus fire can clip a flyer's wings at a critical moment, creating tactical counterplay beyond just "kill it."

**Fly + Disengage stacking:** Since Fly includes built-in Disengage, a model that has both Fly and the separate Disengage keyword doesn't gain anything extra — they're redundant. No need for a special interaction rule.
